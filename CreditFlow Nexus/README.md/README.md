# CreditFlow Nexus

CreditFlow Nexus is an API-driven credit pre-approval middleware that streamlines consumer loan pre-approvals and accelerates digital lending initiatives. The system aggregates credit data from various sources (using Java for FICO API integration and Python for cash flow analysis), provides a unified GraphQL API via Node.js, and integrates legacy mainframe systems through a .NET service. It is containerized for deployment on AWS ECS (with applicant profiles stored in AWS Aurora) and managed with a Jenkins pipeline that even performs chaos testing.

## Key Features
- **Automated Pre-Approval:** Aggregates FICO scores and cash flow data for fast pre-approval decisions.
- **Unified API Access:** A GraphQL endpoint exposes pre-approval data.
- **Legacy Integration:** Bridges modern middleware with legacy mainframe systems.
- **Containerized & Scalable:** Supports JSON/Protobuf data formats and is deployed on AWS ECS.
- **Robust CI/CD:** Managed by Jenkins with chaos testing to ensure system resilience.

## How to Get Started

1. **Java FICO Integration:**
   ```bash
   cd java-fico-integration
   mvn clean package
   java -cp target/fico-integration-1.0.0.jar com.creditflownexus.FicoIntegration
Python Cash Flow Analysis:

bash
Copy
cd python-cashflow-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cashflow_analysis.py
Node.js GraphQL API:

bash
Copy
cd node-graphql-api
npm install
npm start
The GraphQL API will be available at http://localhost:5000.

.NET Mainframe Integration:

bash
Copy
cd dotnet-mainframe-integration
dotnet build
dotnet run
The legacy integration API will be available (by default) at [http://localhost:5000] (adjust port settings as necessary).

Containerized Deployment:

bash
Copy
cd container
docker-compose up -d
Jenkins CI/CD: Configure your Jenkins instance with the provided Jenkinsfile in the jenkins/ directory to automate builds, container deployments, and chaos testing.

AWS Aurora Setup: Deploy the Aurora cluster using the CloudFormation template in aws/aurora_setup.json.

Documentation: Refer to the docs/ folder for detailed user and DevOps documentation.

Recommendations & Future Improvements
Modernize legacy mainframe integration with standardized data exchange formats (e.g., Protobuf).
Enhance security measures for data in transit and at rest.
Optimize the CI/CD pipeline based on load testing and performance metrics.
Continuously monitor and improve system resilience via regular chaos testing.
