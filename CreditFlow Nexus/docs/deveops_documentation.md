# CreditFlow Nexus â€“ DevOps Documentation

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining the CreditFlow Nexus middleware.

## Deployment
- **Containerization:** All components are containerized using Docker.
- **AWS ECS:** The middleware is deployed on AWS ECS with applicant data stored in an AWS Aurora cluster.
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins automates the build, test, and chaos testing processes.

## Monitoring & Testing
- **Chaos Testing:** Jenkins pipelines include chaos tests (e.g., container restarts) to validate system resilience.
- **API Monitoring:** Use AWS CloudWatch and other tools to monitor API performance.
- **Backup & Recovery:** Schedule regular backups for the AWS Aurora database.

## Recommended Improvements
- Enhance legacy mainframe integration by adopting modern data exchange formats (e.g., Protobuf).
- Implement advanced security measures for data in transit and at rest.
- Continuously optimize the CI/CD pipeline based on load and performance metrics.
