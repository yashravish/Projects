# DocuSync

**DocuSync** is a version‑controlled document collaboration tool that lets multiple users edit Markdown documents in real‑time. Using Firebase Realtime Database, document changes are broadcast live to all connected clients. A “Commit Version” feature sends the current document snapshot to a backend (deployed on Google App Engine) that maintains a Git‑like version history.

> **Note:** This sample demonstrates core concepts. For production, consider adding operational transforms (OT) or CRDTs for concurrent editing, user authentication, diff/merge functionality, and persistent storage for version history.

## Prerequisites

### For the Flutter App
- Flutter SDK installed (https://flutter.dev)
- A Firebase project configured (with Realtime Database enabled)
- Platform-specific Firebase configuration files (GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS, google-services.json for Android, etc.)

### For the Backend
- Python 3.7+ and pip
- Google Cloud SDK (for deploying to App Engine)

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Flutter Frontend

#### a. Configure Firebase
- Follow the Firebase documentation to add Firebase to your Flutter project.
- Place the Firebase configuration files in the appropriate directories.

#### b. Install Dependencies
In the project root, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
c. Run the App
Launch the app on your desired platform (mobile, web, or desktop):

bash
Copy
flutter run
d. Real-Time Collaboration
The editor listens to updates at the Firebase Realtime Database node documents/doc1.
Editing the text will automatically update Firebase and reflect changes on all connected clients.
e. Commit Version
Tap the save icon in the app bar to “commit” the current document.
(Once integrated) The app will send an HTTP POST request to your backend to store the version snapshot.
2. Backend on Google App Engine
a. Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend/ directory.
Ensure that main.py is present and that you have the required Python packages (Flask).
b. Deploy to App Engine
Deploy using the Google Cloud SDK:

bash
Copy
gcloud app deploy
Your backend will be available at a URL similar to: https://your-project.appspot.com/
Update the commit URL in your Flutter app (_commitVersion() function) accordingly.
c. Version History API
The backend exposes a /commit endpoint to accept commit requests.
It also provides a /history/<document_id> endpoint to fetch the version history for a document.
Future Enhancements
Operational Transforms / CRDTs: Implement to merge concurrent edits more gracefully.
Diff & Merge: Compute diffs between versions and allow rollbacks.
Authentication: Secure the collaboration and versioning features with user login (e.g., Firebase Authentication).
Persistent Storage: Replace the in‑memory version history with a proper database.
Conclusion
DocuSync demonstrates a cross‑platform collaborative Markdown editor with real‑time updates and version control. This sample provides a strong foundation for building a robust, production‑ready document collaboration tool. Enjoy building and extending DocuSync!
