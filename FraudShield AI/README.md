FraudShield AI is a cloud-native, real-time fraud detection engine that combines adaptive machine learning with a multi-language, microservices-based architecture. The project enhances custodial banking security by detecting fraud as it occurs and providing real-time analysis for fraud analysts.

## Final Notes

This “full project” combines multiple technologies:

- **C** for extremely fast transaction processing.
- **Python (TensorFlow)** for developing and retraining adaptive ML models.
- **Java/Spring Boot** for applying business logic and risk scoring.
- **Node.js** for streaming processed data.
- **.NET Core** for creating an interactive dashboard for fraud analysts.
- **AWS Lambda/Kinesis** for real-time, serverless processing.
- **Jenkins** for automating the CI/CD pipeline and security tests.

Feel free to extend, modify, and integrate additional features (such as enhanced security, real-world data integration, and persistent PostgreSQL storage) as needed for your production environment.
