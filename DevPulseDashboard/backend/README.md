# DevPulse Dashboard

**DevPulse Dashboard** is a Developer Productivity Analytics Dashboard that aggregates key metrics such as pull request turnaround time, test pass rates, and Jira issue resolution times. The solution consists of a Python Flask backend (simulating data aggregation) and a React frontend that displays the metrics in a dashboard.

## Prerequisites

### For the Backend
- Python 3.7+
- pip
- (Optional) Gunicorn and Nginx for production deployment
- An AWS EC2 instance (if deploying in the cloud)

### For the Frontend
- Node.js and npm
- Create React App (or similar React boilerplate)

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Backend (Flask API)

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Navigate to the `backend/` directory and run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask Application:

bash
Copy
python app.py
The API will be available at http://localhost:5000/api/metrics.

Testing the API:

Open your browser or use curl/Postman to verify the JSON output.

2. Frontend (React Dashboard)
Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the frontend/ directory and run:

bash
Copy
npm install
Configure the Proxy (for Local Development):

Ensure your package.json includes the following proxy configuration to route API calls to the backend:

json
Copy
"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
Run the React App:

bash
Copy
npm start
The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000 and will fetch metrics from the backend.

3. Deployment on AWS EC2
Backend Deployment:
Launch an EC2 instance and install Python 3.
Transfer your backend code and install dependencies.
Use Gunicorn to run the Flask app behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx).
Ensure that the security group permits traffic on the chosen port (e.g., 5000).
Frontend Deployment:
Build the React app using npm run build.
Serve the static files with Nginx on the same EC2 instance or host them on AWS S3 with CloudFront.
Configure CORS or proxy settings so that the frontend can communicate with the backend.
Future Enhancements
Real Data Integration: Replace the simulated metric values with actual data from your Git provider, Jira, and CI/CD systems.
Enhanced Visualizations: Integrate charting libraries (such as Chart.js or Recharts) for richer data visualization.
Persistent Storage: Store historical metric data in a database to enable trend analysis.
Security: Secure API endpoints and restrict access as needed.
Conclusion
DevPulse Dashboard provides a strong foundation for aggregating and visualizing developer productivity metrics. Customize and extend this solution to integrate with your actual data sources and to add more sophisticated visualizations.

Enjoy building your dashboard!

## Final Notes

- **Customization:**  
  The simulated metrics should be replaced with real API integrations in a production system.

- **Scalability:**  
  Both the backend and frontend can be extended with additional endpoints, improved error handling, and richer UI components.

With all these pieces in place, you now have a complete end‑to‑end solution for **DevPulse Dashboard**. Enjoy building and iterating on your Developer Productivity Analytics Dashboard!
